# ☁️ Heroku Deployment

This bot runs on Heroku as a single always-on **worker** process. Python is
provided by the official Heroku Python buildpack, and FFmpeg is installed
through the Heroku Apt buildpack.

## Option 1: Deploy from the Heroku Dashboard

1. Create a new Heroku app.
2. In **Deploy**, connect the GitHub repository containing this project.
3. In **Settings → Buildpacks**, add these buildpacks in this order:
   - `https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python.git`
   - `https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt`
4. In **Settings → Config Vars**, add the required values from `sample.env`:
   `API_ID`, `API_HASH`, `BOT_TOKEN`, `MONGO_DB_URI`, `LOGGER_ID`,
   `OWNER_ID`, and `STRING_SESSION`.
5. Deploy the `main` branch.
6. In **Resources**, enable one `worker` dyno.

The included `Procfile` starts the bot with:

```bash
python -m ZefronMusic
```

## Option 2: Deploy with Heroku CLI

```bash
heroku login
heroku create
heroku buildpacks:clear
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python.git
heroku buildpacks:add https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-apt
git push heroku main
heroku config:set \
  API_ID="..." \
  API_HASH="..." \
  BOT_TOKEN="..." \
  MONGO_DB_URI="..." \
  LOGGER_ID="..." \
  OWNER_ID="..." \
  STRING_SESSION="..."
heroku ps:scale worker=1
heroku logs --tail
```

Do not commit `.env` or paste credentials into the repository. `COOKIE_URL`
is optional and is not fetched automatically by the current bot configuration.
