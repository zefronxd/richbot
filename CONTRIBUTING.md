# 📝 Coding Standards

To keep the codebase clean and maintainable, please follow these guidelines.

### Python Style

- Follow **PEP 8**.
- Write clean and readable code.
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.

### Naming

Use descriptive names for:

- Variables
- Functions
- Classes
- Files

Good example:

```python
current_song = get_current_song()
```

Avoid:

```python
x = get()
```

### Comments

Only add comments when they improve readability.

Example:

```python
# Skip the current stream if playback fails.
```

Avoid comments that simply repeat what the code already says.

### Configuration

Never hardcode:

- Bot Tokens
- API credentials
- String Sessions
- Database URIs
- Chat IDs
- User IDs

Always use environment variables or configuration files.

### Keep It Modular

When adding new features:

- Reuse existing helper functions whenever possible.
- Keep files organized in the appropriate plugin directory.
- Avoid duplicate code.
- Maintain the existing project structure.
