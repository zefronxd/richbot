## 🛡️ Security Best Practices for Deployment

As **HasiiMusicBot** is a self-hosted Telegram bot, users are responsible for implementing critical security practices:

### 🔐 Credential Protection

- **Never Expose Secrets:** Never commit your **Telegram Bot Token**, **API ID**, **API Hash**, **MongoDB URI**, **Session Strings**, or any other sensitive credentials to version control
- **Use Environment Variables:** Store all credentials in `.env` files (never commit these to git)
- **Rotate Credentials:** Regularly rotate bot tokens and session strings, especially if you suspect compromise
- **Session String Security:** Pyrogram session strings have the same access as your Telegram account - protect them carefully
- **MongoDB Security:** Use strong passwords and enable MongoDB authentication; restrict network access
- **Cookie Files:** If using YouTube cookies for age-restricted content, ensure they're stored securely and not committed to git

### 🖥️ Infrastructure Security

- **Trusted Environments Only:** Run the bot only on secure, trusted systems with restricted access
- **Firewall Configuration:** Configure firewalls to allow only necessary inbound/outbound connections
- **User Permissions:** Run the bot with minimal required system permissions (avoid root/administrator)
- **Log Security:** Protect log files from unauthorized access as they may contain sensitive information
- **VPS/Server Hardening:** Keep your hosting environment patched and secure

### 📦 Dependency Management

- **Regular Updates:** Keep all Python packages updated to patch known vulnerabilities
  ```bash
  pip install -U -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **Dependency Auditing:** Periodically check for vulnerable dependencies
  ```bash
  pip install safety
  safety check -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **System Dependencies:** Keep FFmpeg, Deno, and system packages updated
- **Python Version:** Use supported Python versions (3.10+) with active security updates

### 👥 Access Control

- **Owner ID Protection:** Set `OWNER_ID` to your Telegram user ID only; never share owner privileges
- **Sudo User Management:** Carefully manage sudo users - they have elevated bot permissions
- **Blacklist Feature:** Use the blacklist feature to block abusive users or chats
- **Authorization System:** Use the `/auth` command to grant playback permissions selectively
- **Admin Verification:** Ensure the bot verifies admin status before executing privileged commands

### 🔍 Monitoring & Incident Response

- **Regular Log Reviews:** Monitor `log.txt` for suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts
- **Database Backups:** Regularly backup your MongoDB database
- **Incident Response Plan:** Have a plan for responding to security incidents:
  1. Revoke compromised credentials immediately
  2. Review logs for unauthorized access
  3. Assess data exposure
  4. Notify affected users if necessary
  5. Update credentials and redeploy
- **Rate Limiting:** Be aware of Telegram's rate limits to prevent abuse

### ⚠️ Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

- **❌ Don't:** Commit `.env` files or session files to GitHub
- **❌ Don't:** Share screenshots containing bot tokens or API credentials
- **❌ Don't:** Use the same bot token across multiple deployments
- **❌ Don't:** Run the bot with root privileges
- **❌ Don't:** Expose MongoDB to the public internet without authentication
- **❌ Don't:** Ignore dependency update warnings
- **❌ Don't:** Share your Pyrogram session strings (they provide full account access)
